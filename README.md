# How to run
Open Aseba Studio

Open the PatternFormation.aesl file

The PatternFormation file uses the Random Leader behaviour. In the variable declaration in the top, robot_count is set to 5.
This robot count should be the amount of robots / 2 + 1. 5 was used when 8 robots were experimented with.

To switch to Clean Leader behaviour, simply copy the contents of the CleanLeaderBehaviour file into Aseba studio and completely replace the existing contents.

#
In the Data folder, all data captured for every experiment is available. The filenames are represented by the Leader Behavior, the amount of robots in the experiment followed by the experiment number.
